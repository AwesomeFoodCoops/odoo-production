% endif

<p>You will receive a reminder a few days before your next service. <br/>
You can now come and discover the store and do your shopping, upon presentation of an identity document.</p>

<p>We invite you to connect to <a href="${(object.company_id.website or '')|safe}" style="background-color:transparent;text-decoration-thickness:auto;color:rgb(124, 123, 173);"> The Members Area </a> (in attachment, the procedure to activate it). You will find there a lot of information, in particular your next services, and a forum which will allow you to communicate between members. The current version of the site will evolve and new functionalities will be added in the coming months. A team of volunteer members works to enrich this space to make it useful and convivial.</p>

<p>Access to the store is then on presentation of the cooperator badge. To obtain your badge, you must first come to a photo session organized either at the store or during the general meetings of La Louve. The photo sessions are announced on the Members Area and at the store. As with the Members' Area, the making of badges is carried out by volunteers and requires several stages which can take several days. The complete procedure is described in the Members Area forum (FAQ section). As soon as your badge has been printed, you can collect it at the supermarket reception.</p>

<p>You will find attached a procedure allowing you to activate your personal space.</p>

<p>Regards,<br/>
Tom Boothe</p>

        <field name="body_html"><![CDATA[
<p>Hello flying team members-- </p>
<br/>
<p>Just a reminder to tell you that <h3> the next counting day will be next Thursday, the ${object.convert_format_datatime()}</h3>... it's the last day to perform a flying service and avoid catching up.</p>
<p>The programming of the flying services is done via the members area. Click on “tools”, then “program a steering wheel service”, then “registration”. If you do not have access to the members area, it is always possible to schedule a flying service by contacting the Members' office during its opening hours. </p>
<p>Since the 1st steering wheel count in August 2017, experience shows that the vast majority of steering wheels registers for a service the 3 days preceding the day of the count. The flying places created for Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of week A are therefore systematically taken, which is not the case for all the other days of weeks A, B, C, D. This creates an imbalance. As far as possible, we kindly ask you to try to spread the programming of your services over the 4 weeks A, B, C, D. For information, the most "critical" slots are Sunday morning at 7.15 am, Saturday evening at 7 p.m., Monday from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m.</p>
<h3>What happens if I don't have a credit in my "account" the ${object.convert_format_datatime()}?</h3>
<p>Like the members of all the other teams, you will need 2 catch-ups. So, in total, you will have three services to program and perform before the next countdown day: the 2 catch-ups, and the service you need anyway before the next countdown. (These three services to do are in addition to the catch-ups that you may already need at ${object.company_id.name or ''}).</p>
<h3>How to catch up? </h3>
<p>Unlike the ABCD team members, the flying team members must schedule their overtakes, without exception ... simply by scheduling additional shifts. A member of the flying team cannot use the same catch-up system as that of the ABCD teams. If he shows up at any service to catch up, without having scheduled it, he will not be credited.</p>
<h3>Cancel a scheduled service?</h3>
<p>Scheduling a vacation then missing it without first canceling it will result in the withdrawal of a credit from its service savings account. Members of the flying team may cancel their vacations without penalty up to one hour before their start, at the members' office during opening hours.</p>
<h3>For more information, contact the Membership Office during its opening hours: ${(object.company_id.phone or '')|safe}.</h3>

Your related child will soon be 18 years old. We wish him a happy birthday in advance.

On his birthday, he / she will be unlinked from your account and will lose buyer rights to ${(object.company_id.name or '')|safe}.
If he / she wishes to continue shopping at ${(object.company_id.name or '')|safe}, there are 2 possibilities:
</p>
<ol>
<li>He / she becomes a member of ${(object.company_id.name or '')|safe}.
You must visit our website and register for a welcome meeting, then follow the steps you have taken to become a member of ${(object.company_id.name or '')|safe}.
</li>
<li>He / she becomes attached to an adult... a possibility only if you do not already have another adult in your household associated with your account at ${(object.company_id.name or '')|safe}.
For him / her to become a connected adult, you must both go to the Members' office during opening hours.
Your child must bring a piece of identification and proof that he / she lives at the same address as you.

Have a good day,
