Email Alias feature

- Each team/template will have 2 email alias:

  - 1 for the Coordinators of the team, naming convention of alias for Coordinators: coordos.[week][day][hour]@[domain]
  - 1 for the Members of the Team (including the Coordinators): naming convention of alias for Members: service.[week][day][hour]@[domain]

- Alias domain is configured by parameter object:

  - with key: mail.catchall.domain.
  - value: your email domain (e.g: cooplaloue.fr)

When installing module, there is a script to create email alias automatically for each template, so, mail.catchall.domain must exist
before installing coop_memberspace module.

- There are 2 main objects to store email alias for each team:

  - memberspace_alias: store all alias of team (access via Member config menu: Members > Configuration > Memberspace Alias)
  - memberspace_conversation: store all conversation of each topic (access via Member config menu: Members > Configuration > Memberspace Conversation). Every time a new email which sent to specific alias, a new conversation will be created, then after that, all reply of the conversation will be stored within this conversation.


How Alias works?

Any mail sent to your domain, that doesn't have a defined mailbox, will be sent to your catchall email. Application fetches the emails with a cron (using the module fetchmail) and dispatches them to corresponding virtual mail address (alias)

Note: Make sure you set your created mailbox of Incoming Mail Server as the catch-all.
