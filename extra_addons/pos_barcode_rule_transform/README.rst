======================================
Point of Sale - Barcode Rule Transform
======================================

This module extends Odoo Point Of Sale features, to allow to configure
a python expression to transform the captured value in the barcode.

This is usefull in the case you have a barcode with price information in it,
but you need to add a margin, for instance.

This happens when the supplier is the one printing the label, and you don't
have control over the barcode.


Configuration
=============

* Go to 'Point of Sale' / 'Configuration' / 'Barcode Nomenclatures'
* Edit your barcode rules, according to your barcodes settings
* Add a transform expression to the rule
