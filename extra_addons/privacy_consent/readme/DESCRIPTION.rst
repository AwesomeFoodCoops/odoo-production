This module allows the user to define a set of subjects (partners)
affected by any data processing activity, and establish
a process to ask them for consent to include them in that activity.

For those that need explicit consent as a lawfulness base for personal data
processing, as required by GDPR (article 6.1.a), this module provides the
needed tools to automate it.
