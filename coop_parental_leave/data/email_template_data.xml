You had requested parental leave from the Membership Office.
In order for this leave to be validated, you had 4 weeks to present your child's birth certificate to us.
Unless we are mistaken, we have not seen this document.
Your leave was therefore unsuccessful.

If you chose to keep your place on your team when you requested leave,
your status now reflects your situation when you applied for the leave.
We are waiting for you at your next service.

If you were not part of a team or you decided to leave your team when you requested leave,
your status is now “unsubscribed”.
You are not on a team, so you cannot shop at the store.
To join a team again, you must contact the Membership Office.

La Louve does not keep any copies, we just need to see the certificate.
