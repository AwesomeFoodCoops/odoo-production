This module adds a new field on the product: Force Barcode Rule

If set, when this product is scanned on the POS, it will try to use that 
barcode rule instead of the one that matched the pattern first.

This rule has to still match the pattern, and it should belong to the
same nomenclature that's being used on the POS.
