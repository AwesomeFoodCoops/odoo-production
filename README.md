FoodCoops
=========

These modules provide an Open Source solution to managing cooperative supermarkets in Odoo.

This repository aims to handle a commom Odoo source code for the food coops that take part in the mutualization (and found it). Our code is free, so that coops don't want to fit in the previsous rules can freely fork this Github repository. However, we higly encourage them to not fork the common modules. In that case it would be very difficult for them to enter in the mutualization in the future.
