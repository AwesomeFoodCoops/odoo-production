            <p>You missed 2 consecutive programmed shifts and did not come to a make-up in-between. You have been unsubscribed from your team. The &quot;Unsubscribed&quot; status will show when you swipe your badge at the shop. This does not allow you to shop at your favorite co-op. 
If you think there was a mistake or wish to subscribe to another team please contact us as soon as possible.</p>
