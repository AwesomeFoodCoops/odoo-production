This module extends Odoo Point Of Sale features, to allow to configure
a python expression to transform the captured value in the barcode.

This is usefull in the case you have a barcode with price information in it,
but you need to add a margin, for instance.

This happens when the supplier is the one printing the label, and you don't
have control over the barcode.
